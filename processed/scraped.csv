As cluster and model sizes have grown, machine learning practitioners have developed an increasing variety of techniques to parallelize model training over many GPUs. At first glance, understanding these parallelism techniques may seem daunting, but with only a few assumptions about the structure of the computation these techniques become much more clear芒聙聰at that point, you芒聙聶re just shuttling around opaque bits from A to B like a network switch shuttles around脗聽packets.No parallelismData ParallelismPipeline ParallelismTensor ParallelismExpert Parallelism An illustration of various parallelism strategies on a three-layer model. Each color refers to one layer and dashed lines separate different GPUs. Training a neural network is an iterative process. In every iteration, we do a pass forward through a model芒聙聶s脗聽layers脗聽to compute an output for each training example in a batch of data. Then another pass proceeds脗聽backward脗聽through the layers, propagating how much each parameter affects the final output by computing a脗聽gradient脗聽with respect to each parameter. The average gradient for the batch, the parameters, and some per-parameter optimization state is passed to an optimization algorithm, such as脗聽Adam, which computes the next iteration芒聙聶s parameters (which should have slightly better performance on your data) and new per-parameter optimization state. As the training iterates over batches of data, the model evolves to produce increasingly accurate脗聽outputs.Various parallelism techniques slice this training process across different dimensions,脗聽including:Data parallelism芒聙聰run different subsets of the batch on different脗聽GPUs;Pipeline parallelism芒聙聰run different layers of the model on different脗聽GPUs;Tensor parallelism芒聙聰break up the math for a single operation such as a matrix multiplication to be split across脗聽GPUs;Mixture-of-Experts芒聙聰process each example by only a fraction of each脗聽layer.(In this post, we芒聙聶ll assume that you are using GPUs to train your neural networks, but the same ideas apply to those using any other脗聽neural network脗聽accelerator.)Data parallelismData Parallel脗聽training means copying the same parameters to multiple GPUs (often called 芒聙聹workers芒聙聺) and assigning different examples to each to be processed simultaneously. Data parallelism alone still requires that your model fits into a single GPU芒聙聶s memory, but lets you utilize the compute of many GPUs at the cost of storing many duplicate copies of your parameters. That being said, there are strategies to increase the effective RAM available to your GPU, such as temporarily offloading parameters to CPU memory between脗聽usages.As each data parallel worker updates its copy of the parameters, they need to coordinate to ensure that each worker continues to have similar parameters. The simplest approach is to introduce blocking communication between workers: (1) independently compute the gradient on each worker; (2)脗聽average the gradients across workers; and (3) independently compute the same new parameters on each worker. Step (2) is a blocking average which requires transferring quite a lot of data (proportional to the number of workers times the size of your parameters), which can hurt your training throughput. There are various脗聽asynchronous synchronization schemes脗聽to remove this overhead, but they hurt learning efficiency; in practice, people generally stick with the synchronous脗聽approach.Pipeline parallelismWith脗聽Pipeline Parallel脗聽training, we partition sequential chunks of the model across GPUs. Each GPU holds only a fraction of parameters, and thus the same model consumes proportionally less memory per脗聽GPU.It芒聙聶s straightforward to split a large model into chunks of consecutive layers. However, there芒聙聶s a sequential dependency between inputs and outputs of layers, so a naive implementation can lead to a large amount of idle time while a worker waits for outputs from the previous machine to be used as its inputs. These waiting time chunks are known as 芒聙聹bubbles,芒聙聺 wasting the computation that could be done by the idling脗聽machines.ForwardBackwardUpdateIdle Illustration of a naive pipeline parallelism setup where the model is vertically split into 4 partitions by layer. Worker 1 hosts model parameters of the first layer of the network (closest to the input), while worker 4 hosts layer 4 (which is closest to the output). 芒聙聹F芒聙聺, 芒聙聹B芒聙聺, and 芒聙聹U芒聙聺 represent forward, backward and update operations, respectively. The subscripts indicate on which worker an operation runs. Data is processed by one worker at a time due to the sequential dependency, leading to large 芒聙聹bubbles芒聙聺 of idle time. We can reuse the ideas from data parallelism to reduce the cost of the bubble by having each worker only process a subset of data elements at one time, allowing us to cleverly overlap new computation with wait time. The core idea is to split one batch into multiple microbatches; each microbatch should be proportionally faster to process and each worker begins working on the next microbatch as soon as it芒聙聶s available, thus expediting the pipeline execution. With enough microbatches the workers can be utilized most of the time with a minimal bubble at the beginning and end of the step. Gradients are averaged across microbatches, and updates to the parameters happen only once all microbatches have been脗聽completed.The number of workers that the model is split over is commonly known as脗聽pipeline脗聽depth.During the forward pass, workers only need to send the output (called activations) of its chunk of layers to the next worker; during the backward pass, it only sends the gradients on those activations to the previous worker. There芒聙聶s a big design space of how to schedule these passes and how to aggregate the gradients across microbatches.脗聽GPipe脗聽has each worker process forward and backward passes consecutively and then aggregates gradients from multiple microbatches synchronously at the end.脗聽PipeDream脗聽instead schedules each worker to alternatively process forward and backward脗聽passes.ForwardBackwardUpdateIdleGPipePipeDream Comparison of GPipe and PipeDream pipelining schemes, using 4 microbatches per batch. Microbatches 1-8 correspond to two consecutive data batches. In the image, 芒聙聹(number)芒聙聺 indicates on which microbatch an operation is performed and the subscript marks the worker ID. Note that PipeDream gets more efficiency by performing some computations with stale parameters. Tensor parallelismPipeline parallelism splits a model 芒聙聹vertically芒聙聺 by layer. It芒聙聶s also possible to 芒聙聹horizontally芒聙聺 split certain operations within a layer, which is usually called脗聽Tensor Parallel脗聽training. For many modern models (such as the脗聽Transformer), the computation bottleneck is multiplying an activation batch matrix with a large weight matrix.脗聽Matrix multiplication脗聽can be thought of as dot products between pairs of rows and columns; it芒聙聶s possible to compute independent dot products on different GPUs, or to compute parts of each dot product on different GPUs and sum up the results. With either strategy, we can slice the weight matrix into even-sized 芒聙聹shards芒聙聺, host each shard on a different GPU, and use that shard to compute the relevant part of the overall matrix product before later communicating to combine the脗聽results.One example is脗聽Megatron-LM, which parallelizes matrix multiplications within the Transformer芒聙聶s self-attention and MLP layers.脗聽PTD-P脗聽uses tensor, data, and pipeline parallelism; its pipeline schedule assigns multiple non-consecutive layers to each device, reducing bubble overhead at the cost of more network脗聽communication.Sometimes the input to the network can be parallelized across a dimension with a high degree of parallel computation relative to cross-communication.脗聽Sequence parallelism脗聽is one such idea, where an input sequence is split across time into multiple sub-examples, proportionally decreasing peak memory consumption by allowing the computation to proceed with more granularly-sized脗聽examples.Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)With the脗聽Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)脗聽approach, only a fraction of the network is used to compute the output for any one input. One example approach is to have many sets of weights and the network can choose which set to use via a gating mechanism at inference time. This enables many more parameters without increased computation cost. Each set of weights is referred to as 芒聙聹experts,芒聙聺 in the hope that the network will learn to assign specialized computation and skills to each expert. Different experts can be hosted on different GPUs, providing a clear way to scale up the number of GPUs used for a脗聽model.Illustration of a mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer. Only 2 out of the聽n聽experts are selected by the gating network. (Image adapted from:聽Shazeer et al.,聽2017)GShard脗聽scales an MoE Transformer up to 600 billion parameters with a scheme where only the MoE layers are split across multiple TPU devices and other layers are fully duplicated.脗聽Switch Transformer脗聽scales model size to trillions of parameters with even higher sparsity by routing one input to a single脗聽expert.Other memory saving designsThere are many other computational strategies to make training increasingly large neural networks more tractable. For脗聽example:To compute the gradient, you need to have saved the original activations, which can consume a lot of device RAM.脗聽Checkpointing脗聽(also known as activation recomputation) stores any subset of activations, and recomputes the intermediate ones just-in-time during the backward pass. This saves a lot of memory at the computational cost of at most one additional full forward pass. One can also continually trade off between compute and memory cost by脗聽selective activation recomputation, which is checkpointing subsets of the activations that are relatively more expensive to store but cheaper to脗聽compute.Mixed Precision Training脗聽is to train models using lower-precision numbers (most commonly脗聽FP16). Modern accelerators can reach much higher FLOP counts with lower-precision numbers, and you also save on device RAM. With proper care, the resulting model can lose almost no脗聽accuracy.Offloading脗聽is to temporarily offload unused data to the CPU or amongst different devices and later read it back when needed. Naive implementations will slow down training a lot, but sophisticated implementations will pre-fetch data so that the device never needs to wait on it. One implementation of this idea is脗聽ZeRO脗聽which splits the parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across all available hardware and materializes them as脗聽needed.Memory Efficient Optimizers脗聽have been proposed to reduce the memory footprint of the running state maintained by the optimizer, such as脗聽Adafactor.Compression脗聽also can be used for storing intermediate results in the network. For example,脗聽Gist脗聽compresses activations that are saved for the backward pass;脗聽DALL脗路E脗聽compresses the gradients before synchronizing脗聽them.At OpenAI, we are training and improving large models from the underlying infrastructure all the way to deploying them for real-world problems.

Micro Machine Pocket Play Sets, so tremendously tiny, so perfectly precise, so dazzlingly detailed, you芒聙聶ll want to pocket them all. Micro Machines are Micro Machine Pocket Play Sets sold separately from Galoob. The smaller they are, the better they are.Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech脗聽processing.The Whisper architecture is a simple end-to-end approach, implemented as an encoder-decoder Transformer. Input audio is split into 30-second chunks, converted into a log-Mel spectrogram, and then passed into an encoder. A decoder is trained to predict the corresponding text caption, intermixed with special tokens that direct the single model to perform tasks such as language identification, phrase-level timestamps, multilingual speech transcription, and to-English speech脗聽translation.Other existing approaches frequently use smaller, more closely paired audio-text training datasets,[^reference-1] [^reference-2][^reference-3] or use broad but unsupervised audio pretraining.[^reference-4][^reference-5][^reference-6]脗聽Because Whisper was trained on a large and diverse dataset and was not fine-tuned to any specific one, it does not beat models that specialize in LibriSpeech performance, a famously competitive benchmark in speech recognition. However, when we measure Whisper芒聙聶s zero-shot performance across many diverse datasets we find it is much more robust and makes 50% fewer errors than those脗聽models.About a third of Whisper芒聙聶s audio dataset is non-English, and it is alternately given the task of transcribing in the original language or translating to English.
